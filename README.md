## About
For this sepecific Repo, the main use is to examine and use the differen types of methods and commands within Git and .md files. The main commands examined are the Push commands in Github Cloud and Github Desktop. The repository is also used to Pull files from GitHub cloud to local machines.

## Recommended Tools
Although you can directly develope from the cloud, there are various tools that people can use to work with GitHub pages locally, such as **GitHub Desktop** and **Visual Code Studio**. If someone is using Visual Studio Code as an IDE, I highly recommend downloading Markdown Preview Enhancer.

* [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/): https://desktop.github.com/
* [Visual Code Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/): https://code.visualstudio.com/
  * Markdown Preview Enhancer can be accessed by downloading it directly in Visual Studio Code in the Extensions tab. The extension should be by a developer named Yiyi Wang.

# Recommended Resources
Within these two systems, you must know how to use Markdown GitHub Pages. Besides Markdown, people should know other programming languages to implement them into pages. Common languages used are: Python, JavaScrpt, HTML/CSS, and many more. Below is a list of documentation for commonly used languages on GitHub Pages.

* Python [Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/): https://docs.python.org/3/library/
