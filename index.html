                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>Hello, my name is Matteo Antunez and I’m a second-year student here at Northwest. Although I’m a second-year, I’m currently Junior status at Northwest Missouri State University in the School of Computer Science. At Northwest, I am a Data Science: Computer Science major, and I plan on continuing education to obtain a master degree.</p>

                <h2>The Past that Brings the Future</h2>
                <p>Before I came to Northwest, I finished my K-12 education at Syracuse Public Schools, but have continued my education beyond the classroom. I have always attempted to increase my knowledge, and that has shown through competitions, and my second place national ranking in 2017 in FBLA (Future Business Leaders of America) . <br /><br />To enhance my knowledge, I work a lot with YouTube and local companies to help create a better environment for companies and users alike. When I’m not studying computers, I work with photography and Beat Saber ( :D ).</p>

                <h2>Life Beyond the Classroom</h2>
                <p>Although I am a Junior, my future career plans are foggy. I enjoy almost everything about computers, so I’ve been looking at career options that will allow me to work in different areas to increase my overall knowledge. I have looked at various different career paths, and I have considered working as either a Software Developer or Database Administrator. Those career paths, however, are not set in stone.</p>

                <h2>The Fun Facts</h2>
                <p>Regards to myself, I fun fact many people don’t know is that I am into photography. I have taken a couple free courses on photography and have been hired out locally for photo sessions. Although I don’t post many of my pictures on my LinkedIn account, I do have a personal website that has some examples.</p>
